About
=====

LinkedIn's People You May Know feature doesn't provide any way to sort the page
of results. You cannot sort by last name, or number of connections, or anything 
else. The results you get are fixed. This Firefox add-on fixes that: it takes
your People You May Know results page and lets you sort by a number of
criteria. Want to see the people with the highest number of shared connections
first? You can do that.

You can either compile the add-on from sources, via the Firefox Addon SDK, or
just use the .XPI add-on file directly within Firefox by dragging and dropping.
Once the add-on is installed, a small LinkedIn icon will appear in your status
bar or toolbar, depending on how you configured Firefox.

Once you are viewing your people you may know page, by visiting
http://linkedin.com/people/pymk, you can click on the LinkedIn icon in the
toolbar area and selec the sorting criteria.

The latest version is also available for download directly from
http://www.otakunozoku.com/Downloads/linkedin-pymk-sorter.xpi
